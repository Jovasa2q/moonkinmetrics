# moonkinmetrics.com

This repository holds the source for [moonkinmetrics.com](https://moonkinmetrics.com) along with other pieces of infrastructure required to deploy the site.

There are two distinct pieces to the site:
- `api-scanner` - A Python project which scrapes the Blizzard API for information about talents, pvp leaderboards, and spell icons.
- `ui` - A Next.js frontend which can be rendered to static pages.

Note that this project is under active development and is likely to change quite a bit.

## Contributing

This project is fairly early in development and many aspects of the site are still in flux. As such, contributions are not being accepted right now.

Feedback is always welcome, though!
