# moonkinmetrics.com

This repository holds the source for [moonkinmetrics.com](https://moonkinmetrics.com) along with other pieces of infrastructure required to deploy the site.

There are two distinct pieces to the site:
- `api-scanner` - A Python project which scrapes the Blizzard API for information about talents, pvp leaderboards, and spell icons.
- `ui` - A Next.js frontend which can be rendered to static pages.
